This is a super simple bound method example/challenge using Ruby.
If you want to run it you should watch the output console with the following command:
```bash
$ tail -f console.txt
```
Then you can run the script with:
```bash
ruby runtime-compile.rb
```

Or, if you want to increase the difficulty of the challenge a little bit, you can get the latest script from the github artifacts where the source code won't be visible.
(a version of the script with configurable source code will be available soonâ„¢.)

(If you dont have ruby in your system you can use the provided devcontainer.)
